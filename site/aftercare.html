		<p>Your new tattoo will have a light coating of petroleum jelly on it and may be temporarily bandaged to keep it from bleeding or oozing onto you, your clothes, your car, or people. It will also help to seal the tattoo and keep it clean until you can remove the bandage. You can remove the bandage at any time, as long as you have access to clean water and tissues or paper towels or a shower or some other way to wash it, as it will be messy when the bandage is removed. The bandage should immediately be disposed of in an appropriate way, as it is contaminated with your blood. It is recommended that ice be put on a fresh large tattoo to keep the swelling down.</p>

		<p>You can wash the tattoo with soap and water as often as you want. You do not have to treat the tattoo with ointment. It will heal. Ointment does not make a difference in the long term color or quality of a tattoo. People like to use ointment so that the tattoo heals softly and smoothly instead of like a scab, which can be crunchy and unsightly for a week or two. People also want to use ointment to make them feel more comfortable during the healing process. The only ointment that we have found to be fairly safe to use is Ink Fixx, and even some people will get a problematic "classic ointment reaction" to it, but it is extrememly rare. We usually carry the Ink Fixx.  Hand or skin lotions are ok to use after the skin has sealed over. They are not good to use while the skin is still open because they sting and cause trauma.</p>

		<p>Ointments often cause problems. We strongly recommend that you DO NOT use greasy ointments that contain Petroleum Jelly, or preparations such as A&D ointment, Aquaphor, Triple Antibiotic ointment, Neosporin, other kinds of antibiotic ointments or Tattoo Goo. If you use these ointments and develop a rash or a problem with your tattoo-- you do it at your own risk and against our recommendation.</p>

		<p>Antibiotics and antibiotic ointments are used to treat an active infection. Tattoos that become infected are very rare, but do happen occasionally. The infections are not from our needles, they tend to come from bacteria that is picked up on the skin after the tattoo is applied. NJ law requires us to describe the signs and symptoms of an infection, therefore: The signs or symptoms of an infection may include excessive soreness, abnormal swelling, redness or heat, accompanied by pus or a foul smelling odor coming from a wound. A red line under the skin that appears to travel from the tattoo needs immediate medical treatment.</p>

		<p>You can go swimming in a pool or in the ocean. Swimming or bathing does not hurt the tattoo. Sunburn or contaminated water , or super bleached water (like in a public hot tub) may hurt the tattoo. Tanning will not be good on the site of the tattoo during the healing phase, and we suggest suntan lotion over bright tattoos to preserve their color. Going to the gym is OK, but protect your tattoo from the gym equipment and germs.</p>

		<p>Problem areas of the body (for healing) are where it creases or bends or rubs on itself or on clothes ( like a bra-strap or belt). The inside top of the lower fore-arm can be aggravated by pressing against the biceps while sleeping. The backs of the forearms can pick up a lot of germs by clients that work or spend a lot of time leaning across a counter. Efforts should be made to prevent the tattoo from being aggravated.</p>

		<p>If you think you are having a problem, feel free to call us or come in to show us. If it is a serious problem, we recommend that you see a doctor. If you do not have a doctor and would like to be referred to a doctor that will see you, please let us know and we will try to make arrangements for you to see a doctor at your own expense.</p>

		<h4>Navel Piercing Aftercare</h4>

		<p>Your body may not think that it’s normal to have a piece of metal lodged in it, even though it was done under aseptic conditions. We use sterile 316L (implant grade surgical steel), and a sterile needle. The only source of potential infection could come from you; therefore, proper aftercare is a priority.</p>

		<p>Once pierced, your body should immediately do some blood clotting at the site of the wound, and use other mechanisms to help it heal A mild degree of redness, swelling, and heat at the piercing are all normal. A normal piercing could be tender for a few days. Not all day every day, the discomfort is usually only noticed periodically. Ibuprofen is the drug of choice. (ADVIL, or generic) It will relieve the discomfort, decrease swelling, and cool the heat. Aspirin or Tylenol are not recommended. Ice will help a lot and should be put on the piercing as soon as practical like, when you get home. You can put ice on it as often as you want. Wounds that swell can become a little itchy. Don’t scratch at it.</p>

		<p>The most common cause of infections associated with belly button piercings is people who can't stop playing with them with dirty fingers.</p>

		<p>Wash your hands and fingertips often, and before cleaning your piercing. You should use a gentle liquid antibacterial soap, twice a day on the jewelry, and in the piercing, with your clean fingertips. We strongly recommend Provon Medicated Solution. The jewelry should either be moved up and down in the wound, or turned back and forth so the skin does not try to attach itself to it. The ball, or balls, on a curved barbell should be checked to make sure that they are on tight. The most common cause of a “lost” or closed piercing, is the loss of one of the balls that screw onto the end of a barbell. Rinse with water, and dry. For the first few days you may want to use an anti-bacterial ointment on the shaft of the jewelry and in the wound to reduce the stinging sensation that may occur. This pain arises from the movement of the jewelry in the fresh wound before the inner walls of the wound can start to heal, and has been described as feeling, “ like a sliver of glass is stuck in there”. A normal piercing may naturally tighten around the jewelry, making it difficult to turn or move up and down when dry.</p>

		<p>A common cause of problem healing is constant use of an ointment, especially one that is causing a local allergic response. Antibiotic ointment use should be minimal and only for a day or two.</p>

		<p>It is not uncommon for a fresh navel piercing to bleed a tiny bit for the first day or two, depending on your activity level. After that , the wound may drain a sticky clear or whitish-yellow fluid which becomes crusty on the jewelry. This crust should be removed during cleaning.</p>

		<p>Another common cause of a problem with healing would be a barbell that is too short. It has often been the case that although the barbell appeared to fit ok at the time of the piercing, the young lady would then retain water, maybe put on a couple pounds, and maybe have a little uncontrolled swelling occur around the piercing, and before you know it, the balls appear to become imbedded into the skin--not so much when standing up, but when laying down. If this happens to be the case, the jewelry needs to be changed to longer jewelry immediately.</p>

		<p>If you go swimming in clean water, like a pool, you should clean your piercing afterwards. Salt water, like the ocean, is good for a piercing. Jacuzzis are probably not a good idea for the first couple days. Showers are great. Baths are probably not a good idea at first either. The idea is to keep germs out of it. Creek water, swamp water not good.</p>

		<p>Once your piercing is no longer sore to touch, is not draining, and the jewelry can be moved around freely within, you can consider changing jewelry. Fancy jewelry with intricate shapes or stones mounted in silver designs can often look sensational for a night on the town, a weekend at the beach, or a romantic engagement, but may not be suitable for long term wear, and may cause irritation. Consider wearing the most comfortable jewelry most of the time. You should learn how your jewelry is made to open or close, and the type of metal or material used to make it. You can easily become familiar with the processes required to change it yourself. Curved barbells with stones usually come apart by unscrewing the top ball or stone. Plain curved barbells usually come apart by unscrewing either ball ( whichever comes off first). Same with circular barbells. Captive bead rings usually require a tool (ring opening pliers) to release the tension of the ring enough for the ball to be released. They also require a tool to “round out” the ring and close it (ring closing pliers), enough so that it can then be opened ever so slightly enough (with the ring opening pliers), to place the bead back into the ring.</p>

		<p>It can be said that all piercing eventually heal. The object is to get them to heal soon, with minimal amount of problems or scarring. Vitamin C, multivitamins, and Zinc supplements have been used successfully to speed healing during the first couple weeks. Hot soaks and compresses with ¼ tsp. Sea salt per cup of clean water are strongly suggested for navel piercing. This can be done twice a day for 10-15 minutes. Avoid wearing clothing that irritates the piercing.</p>


		<p>Many normal bellybutton piercing get a little red bump at one or both ends of the jewelry. There are many suggestions as to how to make them go away. The warm soaks with sea salt should be used first. More aggressive approaches begin with using hydrogen peroxide to clean the area often, with a Q-tip. People have successfully irrigated their problem piercing with Bactine. We do not recommend alcohol or betadine to be used.</p>

		<p>If you think you have a problem that is not normal, please feel free to call us, or stop in. We would encourage you to see a doctor if you think you are getting an infection, or if you are having some kind of problem that is causing a concern. Your family doctor may want to have a look, and may want to prescribe antibiotics for a problem case . Headlight Tattoo Inc. maintains a relationship with a Licensed Physician, as required by State code and the Gloucester County Health Department. If you would like to know of a doctor that will see you about a problem with your piercing, please ask, and we will provide the name and location of a Licensed Physician who has agreed to see you. This Physician may charge you a fee. </p>

		<p>For a navel piercing to be fully healed, to the point where the jewelry can be removed for a few days without it closing up may take a year or two.</p>

		<a name="tongue"><h3>Tongue</h3></a>
		<h4>Tongue Piercing Aftercare</h4>

		<p>Your tongue may not think that it’s normal to have a piece of metal lodged in it, even though it was done under aseptic conditions. We use sterile 316L (implant grade surgical steel ), and a sterile needle. The only source of potential infection could come from you; therefore, proper aftercare is a priority .</p>

		<p>Once your tongue is pierced, your body should immediately do some blood clotting at the site of the wound, and use its other mechanisms to help it heal. A mild irritating sting,, usually located on the underside of the tongue at the point where the needle came through, is normal during the first day or so. A significant amount of swelling of the entire tongue, and a small amount of blood at the piercing are also normal. A normal piercing could get tender after a few days, as a result of the constant swelling that usually occurs. A piercing creates a wound. You will have a wound through your tongue. Don’t play with the jewelry with dirty fingers. Keep your mouth clean. Use antiseptic mouthwash often. We recommend that you use a mixture of half water and half antiseptic mouthwash. You will need to rinse your mouth out with it after you eat ,drink (except water) , or smoke. If you use antiseptic mouthwash that is blue, your tongue may , after a few days, appear green. If you use mouthwash that is yellow, your tongue may appear somewhat yellow. The tissues of your mucous membranes are only being stained by excessive mouthwash use. This condition is O.K., however, you may want to rinse with mouthwash less often if the discoloration persists; which means you may need to do less snacking or smoking, which will require less rinsing. Stay well hydrated during your healing process, and drink plenty of water.</p>

		<p>Your tongue piercing may itch after a few days. Don’t scratch at it, pick at it, and try not to play with it while it is healing. Clean it in the evening before you go to bed with a q-tip and Hydrogen Peroxide, and again in the morning before going out. Clean the holes on top and bottom with a Peroxide soaked Q-tip, and try to remove any nasty buildup that will occur on the balls of the jewelry and on the shaft that may be exposed, but especially on the bottom of the tongue at the piercing site and on the jewelry. Check the balls on the jewelry and make sure that they are finger tight. After a few days you will probably notice a bump or callous at the piercing site on top, and almost always on the bottom. This is a mound of dead cells that usually takes a week or so to go away. Using the peroxide will help clear the dead skin and cells away. When cleaning, move the jewelry around a little and rotate it so the skin won’t try to attach itself to it. By no means should you rinse or gargle with peroxide, as this will only kill a lot of normal healthy cells.</p>


		<p>Discomfort usually comes in sessions and is not constant. Younger people seem to suffer less than older people with tongue piercing. Ibuprofen is the drug of choice. (Advil, or generic). It will relieve the discomfort and decrease swelling. Aspirin or Tylenol are not recommended as they tend to interfere with normal clotting. Ice will help a lot and should be used to chill the tongue as soon as practical when you get home. You can put ice in your mouth as often as you want. Your local pharmacy will carry a few different oral wound care preparations. We recommend Glyoxide for those who are in excessive discomfort from the soreness. Glyoxide applied to the wound will quickly relieve pain. The trade off is that it will make you drool or swallow excessively for a while. It may be worth it. The general consensus from people who have had difficult recoveries from tongue piercing is that the worst discomfort and most complaining comes 5 or 6 days after the piercing. If you fall into this group, be assured that your tongue will soon be back to normal size. It is the size and the swelling that seems to cause the discomfort. It is difficult to eat your normal meals when your tongue takes up that much space in your mouth. Try to focus on things that you can easily eat like soft foods, yogurt, ice cream, jello, etc. If you want to eat steak, chops or other whole foods, you can cut or break it into small cubes or chunks and swallow them like you would a pill.</p>

		<p>Your tongue was probably pierced with a straight 14 gauge barbell. We often use 7/8 inch or sometimes 1inch long studs. The jewelry may seem too long at first. Once the tongue swells it should fit just right. </p>

		<p>When the swelling goes down again, you may want to change to a shorter barbell. Some people even want to upgrade to a 12 gauge barbell (which is slightly fatter). Everyone’s tongue is different , and you can decide what size you’d like to live with. We recommend that you become familiar with the processes required to change it yourself. We will be glad to change it for you for a small fee.</p>

		<p>It can be said that all piercing eventually heal. The object is to get them to heal soon, with minimal amount of problems or scarring. Vitamin C, multivitamins, and Zinc supplements have been used successfully to speed healing during the first couple weeks. For the life of the piercing, the jewelry should be cleaned regularly. After a month or so, the mouthwash sessions may subside to mornings and evenings. When you feel ready, the jewelry may be removed for a moment or two once or twice a week and cleaned thoroughly, with a toothbrush or Q-tip.</p>

		<p>For a tongue piercing to be fully healed, to the point where the jewelry can be removed for a few days without it closing up may take a year or two. If you decide that you don’t want to have a tongue piercing anymore, just take it out. Continue to clean the wound for a few days. It will heal to a tiny scar, probably undetectable to the naked eye, if removed during the first few months. After several years, there may be a more noticeable scar….more like a dimple in the skin.</p>

		<p>If you think you have a problem that is not normal, please feel free to call us, or stop in. We would encourage you to see a doctor if you think you are getting an infection, or if you are having some kind of problem that is causing a concern. Your family doctor may want to have a look, and may want to prescribe antibiotics for a problem case .

		<a name="nostril"><h3>Nostril</h3></a>
		<h4>Nostril Piercing Aftercare</h4>

		<p>Your nose may not think that it’s normal to have a piece of metal lodged in it, even though it was done under aseptic conditions, and with a sterile needle. Your body should immediately activate some blood clotting mechanism at the site of the wound, direct its immune system to send a zillion white blood cells to the area, and use its other mechanisms to help it heal. A mild degree of redness, maybe a tiny bit of swelling, and heat at the piercing are all normal. A normal piercing could be tender for a few days. Not “all day every day,”---- the discomfort is often noticed periodically. Ibuprofen is the drug of choice. (ADVIL, or generic) It will relieve the discomfort, decrease swelling, and cool the heat. Aspirin or Tylenol are not recommended. Ice will help a lot and should be put on the piercing as soon as practical when you get home. You can put ice on it as often as you want. Wounds that are healing can become a little itchy . Don’t scratch at it. </p>

		<p>Your nostril was probably pierced with a straight 18-20 gauge nostril stud that was bent into an L shape. We only bend into an L for easy insertion and to make for an easy removal. Some popular nasal jewelry comes in the shape of a “screw”, but we had too many people who can’t get the jewelry out or put it back in. So, we use the L shape. Many people will accidentally dislodge the jewelry when washing their face or when sleeping. If this happens, you need to find the jewelry immediately and clean it off with alcohol or soap and water, and gently, but assertively re-insert it</p>

		<p>Wash your hands and fingertips before cleaning your piercing. Use the Benzalkonium Chloride piercing solution on the tip of a Q-tip to clean the piercing and the jewelry at least twice daily. Clean the outside first, and then use the other side of the Q-tip to clean the inside of the nostril, removing any crusties or debris that may accumulate on the jewelry.</p>
		
		<p>When cleaning, move the jewelry around a little and rotate it so the skin won’t try to attach itself to it. Don’t get any make-up in or on the piercing, especially the sparkly kind. It might be stained with blood on the inside for a day or two. Continue to gently clean as needed.</p>

		<p>If you go swimming in clean water, like a pool, you should clean your piercing afterwards. Salt water, like the ocean, is good for a piercing.

		<a name="lip"><h3>Lip</h3></a>
		<h4>Lip Piercing Aftercare</h4>
		<p>Your lip may not think that it’s normal to have a piece of metal lodged in it, even though it was done under aseptic conditions. We use sterile 316L (implant grade surgical steel ), and a sterile needle. The only source of potential infection could come from you; therefore, proper aftercare is a priority.</p>
		
		<p>Once your lip is pierced, your body should immediately activate some blood clotting factors to the site of the wound, and use its other mechanisms to help it heal. A mild irritating sting at the point where the needle came through, is normal during the first day or so. A significant amount of swelling of the lip, and a small amount of blood on the inside of the piercing are also normal. A normal piercing could remain tender for a few days. Swelling of the lip is usually only temporary, perhaps a few days. A piercing creates a wound. You will have a wound through your lip. Don’t play with the jewelry with dirty fingers. Keep your mouth clean. Use antiseptic mouthwash often. We recommend that you use a mixture of half water and half antiseptic mouthwash. You will need to rinse your mouth out with it after you eat ,drink (except water) , or smoke. If you use antiseptic mouthwash that is blue, the inside of your mouth may , after a few days, appear green. If you use mouthwash that is yellow, the inside of your mouth may appear somewhat yellow. The tissues of your mucous membranes are only being stained by excessive mouthwash use. This condition is O.K., however, you may want to rinse with mouthwash less often if the discoloration persists; which means you may need to do less snacking or smoking, which will require less rinsing. Stay well hydrated during your healing process, and drink plenty of water. Your lip piercing may itch after a few days. Don’t scratch at it, pick at it, and try not to play with it while it is healing.</p>

		<p>You will be provided with a bottle of Benzylkonium Chloride ( BZK). This solution should be used on the outer portion of your piercing only; on a saturated Q-tip twice a day. Use the Q-tip to remove any debris on the outside of the piercing while cleaning it. Clean the inside of the mouth portion in the evening before you go to bed with a Q-tip and Hydrogen Peroxide, and again in the morning before going out. First wash your hands with soap and water and then with clean finger tips, while cleaning the jewelry, check that the ball is on finger tight, and spin or rotate the jewelry and use a Q-tip to push away any skin on the inside of the lip that may be trying to attach or grow over top of the jewelry. Try to remove any nasty buildup that will occur on the jewelry. After a few days you will may notice a bump or callous at the piercing site on the inside, and occasionally on the outside. This is a mound of dead cells that usually takes a week or so to go away. Using the peroxide will help clear the dead cells away on the inside of the lip, and the BZK solution on the outside. By no means should you rinse or gargle with peroxide, as this will only kill a lot of normal healthy cells.</p>

		<p>Discomfort usually comes in sessions and is not constant. Ibuprofen is the drug of choice. (Advil, or generic). It will relieve the discomfort and decrease swelling. Aspirin or Tylenol are not recommended as they tend to interfere with normal clotting. Ice will help a lot and should be used to chill the lip as soon as practical when you get home. You can put ice in your mouth or against the inside and outside of your lip as often as you want. Your local pharmacy will carry a few different oral wound care preparations. We recommend GLYOXIDE for those who are in excessive discomfort from the piercing. Glyoxide applied to the inside of the lip wound will quickly relieve pain. The trade off is that it will make you drool or swallow excessively for a while. It may be worth it. If your lip is sore for a few days and you don’t feel like eating regular foods, try foods that you can easily eat like soft foods, yogurt, ice cream, jello, etc.</p>

		<p>Your labret was probably pierced with a 14 gauge labret stud with a disc backing. The front piece of this type of jewelry is what will need to be unscrewed if you would like to remove it, or change it. It is either a small ball or a small ball with a gem in it. We often use 3/8 ,7/16, or ½ inch labret studs for an initial piercing. The jewelry may seem too long at first. Once the lip swells it should fit just right. </p>

		<p>When the swelling goes down again, you may want to change to a shorter piece of jewelry. Everyone’s lip is different , and you can decide what size you’d like to live with. We recommend that you become familiar with labret or lip jewelry, and the processes or tools required to change it yourself. We recommend that you obtain a pair of forceps that you need to hold the disc backing of a labret stud in order to unscrew the front. We also recommend for a lip piercing done with a captive bead ring, that you obtain ring opening and closing pliers for that type of jewelry. Lip piercing are done with 7/16 inch or larger rings, to account for any swelling that may occur. Most people prefer much smaller sized rings after swelling subsides. We will be glad to change any piercing for you for a small fee. ( usually $10 ).</p>

		<p>It can be said that all piercing eventually heal. The object is to get them to heal soon, with minimal amount of problems or scarring. Vitamin C, multivitamins, and Zinc supplements have been used successfully to speed healing during the first couple weeks. For the life of the piercing, the jewelry should be cleaned regularly. After a month or so, the mouthwash sessions may subside to mornings and evenings. When you feel ready, the jewelry may be removed for a moment or two once or twice a week and cleaned thoroughly, with a Q-tip.</p>

		<p>For a lip piercing to be fully healed, to the point where the jewelry can be removed for a few days without it closing up may take a year or two. If you decide that you don’t want to have a lip piercing anymore, just take it out. Continue to clean the wound for a few days. It will heal to a tiny scar, probably undetectable to the naked eye, if removed during the first few months. After several years, there may be a more noticeable scar….more like a dimple in the skin.</p>

		<h4>Ear/Cartilage Aftercare</h4>
		<p>Your body may not think that it’s normal to have a piece of metal lodged in it, even though it was done under aseptic conditions, and with a sterile needle. Your body should immediately start some blood clotting at the site of the wound, and use other mechanisms to help it heal. A mild degree of redness, maybe a tiny bit of swelling, and heat at the piercing are all normal. A normal piercing could be tender for a few days. Not “all day every day,”---- the discomfort is often noticed periodically. Ibuprofen is the drug of choice. (ADVIL, or generic) It will relieve the discomfort, decrease swelling, and cool the heat. Aspirin or Tylenol are not recommended. Ice will help a lot and should be put on the piercing as soon as practical when you get home. You can put ice on it as often as you want. Wounds that are healing can become a little itchy . Don’t scratch at it. </p>

		<p>It is possible to accidentally dislodge the jewelry when washing or drying your face, coming your hair, or when sleeping. If this happens, you need to find the jewelry immediately and clean it off with alcohol or soap and water, and gently, but assertively re-insert it.</p>

		<p>Wash your hands and fingertips before cleaning your piercing. Use the Benzalkonium Chloride piercing solution on the tip of a q-tip to clean the piercing and the jewelry at least twice daily. Clean the piercing and the jewelry as best you can, removing any crusties or debris that may accumulate on the jewelry.</p>
		
		<p>When cleaning, move the jewelry around a little and rotate it so the skin won’t try to attach itself to it. Don’t get any make-up in or on the piercing, especially the sparkly kind. Your piercing may ooze sticky fluid for a few days.</p>

		<p>If you go swimming in clean water, like a pool, you should clean your piercing afterwards. Salt water, like the ocean, is good for a piercing. Jacuzzis are probably not a good idea for the first couple days. Showers are great. Baths probably not a good idea at first either. The idea is to keep germs out of it. Creek water, swamp water, not good.</p>

		<p>Once your piercing is no longer sore to touch, is not draining, and the jewelry can be moved around freely within, you can consider changing jewelry. We recommend that you become familiar with the processes required to change it yourself</p>

		<a name="nipple"><h3>Nipple</h3></a>
		<h4>Nipple Piercing Aftercare</h4>
		<p>Your body may not think that it’s normal to have a piece of metal lodged in it, even though it was done under aseptic conditions. We use sterile 316L (implant grade surgical steel ), and a sterile needle. The only source of potential infection could come from you; therefore, proper aftercare is a priority.</p>
		<p>Once pierced, your body should immediately do some blood clotting at the site of the wound, and use other mechanisms to help it heal A mild degree of redness, swelling, and heat at the piercing are all normal. A normal piercing could be tender for a few days. Not “all day every day,”---- the discomfort is usually only noticed periodically. Ibuprofen is the drug of choice. (ADVIL, or generic) It will relieve the discomfort, decrease swelling, and cool the heat. Aspirin or Tylenol are not recommended. Ice will help a lot and should be put on the piercing as soon as practical when you get home. You can put ice on it as often as you want. Wounds that swell can become a little itchy . Don’t scratch at it.</p>

		<p>A potential cause of an infection of a nipple piercing would be dirty fingers. </p>

		<p>Wash your hands and fingertips often, and before cleaning your piercing. You should use a gentle liquid antibacterial soap, twice a day on the jewelry, and in the piercing, with your clean fingertips. We strongly recommend proven medicated solution. The jewelry should either be moved up and down in the wound, or turned back and forth so the skin does not try to attach itself to it. Rinse with water, and dry. The ball, or balls, on a curved barbell should be checked to make sure that they are on tight. The most common cause of a “lost” or closed piercing, is the loss of one of the balls that screw onto the end of a barbell. For the first few days you may want to use an anti-bacterial ointment on the shaft of the jewelry and in the wound to reduce the stinging sensation that may occur. This pain arises from the movement of the jewelry in the fresh wound before the inner walls of the wound can start to heal, and has been described as feeling, “like a sliver of glass is stuck in there”. A normal piercing may naturally tighten around the jewelry , making it difficult to turn or move up and down when dry.</p>

		<p>A common cause of problem healing is constant use of an ointment, especially one that is causing a local allergic response. Antibiotic ointment use should be minimal and only for a day or two.</p>

		<p>It is not uncommon for a fresh nipple piercing to bleed a tiny bit for the first day or two, depending on your activity level. After that , the wound may drain a sticky clear or whitish-yellow fluid which becomes crusty on the jewelry. This crust should be removed during cleaning.</p>

		<p>If you go swimming in clean water, like a pool, you should clean your piercing afterwards. Salt water, like the ocean, is good for a piercing. Jacuzzis are probably not a good idea for the first couple days. Showers are great. Baths probably not a good idea at first either. The idea is to keep germs out of it. Creek water, swamp water, not good.</p>

		<p>Once your piercing is no longer sore to touch, is not draining, and the jewelry can be moved around freely within, you can consider changing jewelry. Fancy jewelry with intricate shapes or stones mounted in silver designs can often look sensational for a romantic engagement, but may not be suitable for long term wear, and may cause irritation. Consider wearing the most comfortable jewelry most of the time. You should learn how your jewelry is made to open or close, and the type of metal or material used to make it. You can easily become familiar with the processes required to change it yourself. Curved barbells with stones usually come apart by unscrewing the top ball or stone. Plain curved barbells usually come apart by unscrewing either ball ( whichever comes off first). Same with circular barbells. Captive bead rings usually require a tool (ring opening pliers) to release the tension of the ring enough for the ball to be released. They also require a tool to “round out” the ring and close it (ring closing pliers), enough so that it can then be opened ever so slightly enough (with the ring opening pliers), to place the bead back into the ring.</p>

		<p>It can be said that all piercing eventually heal. The object is to get them to heal soon, with minimal amount of problems or scarring. Vitamin C, multivitamins, and Zinc supplements have been used successfully to speed healing during the first couple weeks. Hot soaks and compresses with ¼ tsp. Sea salt per cup of clean water are strongly suggested for navel piercing. This can be done twice a day for 10-15 minutes. Avoid wearing clothing that irritates the piercing.</p>

		<p>Many normal nipple piercing gets a little red bump at one or both ends of the jewelry. There are many suggestions as to how to make them go away. The warm soaks with sea salt should be used first. More aggressive approaches begin with using hydrogen peroxide to clean the area often, with a Q-tip. People have successfully irrigated their problem piercing with Bactine. We do not recommend alcohol or betadine to be used.</p>

		<h4>Cleaning Your Piercing</h4>
		<p>We suggest using a sea salt solution to clean your piercing twice a day. You will be given a small bag of sea salt that you can use to make warm sea salt solutions to do your cleanings and compresses. A strong sea salt solution can be made by adding half a teaspoon sea salt to an 8 ounce cup of warm water. This bag should last one week. You can purchase some additional sea salt at a local supermarket or grocery store. For convenience, you may also purchase a bottle of H2Ocean Sea Salt Piercing Spray for daily use. If you are not in a position to make sea salt compresses and need to clean your piercing you can purchase some sterile saline solution that is recommended for wound care. it comes in a pressurized can and can be found in the wound care section of a pharmacy.</p>
		
		<p>It is best to clean your piercing after you are finished in the shower as soap and suds can slip into the piercing and irritate it. When using your pre mixed saline take a q tip and saturate it with the solution. Gently clean one side of the piercing. Make sure to remove any discharge that may have accumulated on the side of the jewelry. Repeat this process on the other side of the jewelry with a fresh q tip.</p>
		
		<p>To Speed up the healing process it is a good idea to do a sea salt compress in replacement of one of you regular daily cleanings (its usually best to do this at night). Simply soak a sterile gauze pad in warm saline and hold it onto the piercing for about 15 minutes. These soaks will help promote healing in the piercing by drawing any unwanted discharge out of the piercing.</p>
		
		<h4>Care For Your Piercing</h4>
		<p>Leave the bandage on your jewelry for 24 hours. This will help hold the jewelry in place and allow for the tissue to grow. Every night before bed, for one week, place a small bandage over top of the piercing. This will help keep it secure until the tissue has properly grown and the jewelry is anchored. Make sure the adhesive is not touching the actual piercing.</p>
		
		<h4>Things To Know</h4>
		<p>Do not touch your piercing. Hands are dirty and touching your piercing when you're not cleaning it is the easiest way to contract an infection. Don't let other people or animals contaminate it. Keep it clean, dry, and free of any irritants.</p>
		<p>NJ law requires us to describe the signs and symptoms of an infection, therefore the signs or symptoms of an infection may include excess soreness, abnormal swelling, redness or heat, accompanied by pus or a foul smelling odor coming from a wound. If you think you have an infection or a serious problem you should contact a physician who will agree to see you for a minimal fee.</p>

		<a name="problems"><h3>Problems</h3></a>
		<h4>What's This Bump on My Piercing?</h4>
		<p>There are three basic types of "bumps" that may form near or on a piercing. Follicular Cysts,
		Keloids, and Abscesses are all caused by different things. If you can determine what the 
		bump is and what caused it to appear, then you can make a plan to get rid of it.
		Always try the gentlest method first, and only try the stronger methods as a last 
		resort. Try just one method at a time, and keep at it for at least a week to see
		how its working.</p>

		<h4>Follicular Cysts</h4>
		<p>Are usually nothing more than an obstruction (a hair or some dead skin cells) inside the
		piercing that cause liquid-filled bumps. The area may be reddish and tender, and may bleed
		a little bit. Follicular Cysts are somewhat more common in tragus, eyebrow, and nostril piercings.
		To help get rid of them:
		<ul>
		<li>Change the jewelry. -consult with your piercer so that together, you can choose appropriate jewelry that will speed healing.</li>
		<li>Hot sea salt soaks may help draw out the obstruction. Soaks can also soothe the area and help drain fluids.</li>
		<li>Hydrogen Peroxide, in gel form, can help remove dead tissue and fluids from follicular cysts.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Abscesses</h4>
		<p>Are large, growing, very painful swellings, under or behind the piercing rather than right next to it. Infectious fluid has become trapped in the piercing; there is little or no drainage from the piercing. You may want to try downsizing the gauge to encourage fluid drainage. Herbal compresses have been very effective for some. If you don't see immediate results, call a piercing-aware physician. Don't delay a doctor's visit if you suspect an abscess- they're potentially very serious.</p>
		
		<p>You can avoid abscesses by piercing with jewelry that's not too heavy, too thick, or too large in diameter. Not stretching, playing with, or removing a piercing too soon. Being very careful with multiple piercings or repiercings.</p>

		<h4>Keloids</h4>
		<p>Are excess scar tissue growth formed as a callous by the body to protect the piercing from uncomfortable friction. Piercees with more skin pigment may be at a slightly higher risk of developing keloids. </p>
		
		<p>Keloids are usually caused by tight, restrictive, or rough clothing or accessories such as eyeglasses that rub against the piercing. Inappropriate jewelry shape, composition or style. Poor placement of the piercing (too deep, too shallow, or crooked).</p>
		
		<p>To get rid of keloids watch out for bedding, clothing, towels, helmets, hairbrushes, and other sources of friction. Placement and jewelry should be well-matched. If necessary, have your piercer change the jewelry or repierce. Try the following methods in the order that they appear. Aspirin is especially effective for oral piercings. Remember that keloids are usually a symptom rather than the source of a problem. They won't go away unless you resolve the original problem.</p>

		<h4>Hydration</h4>
		<p>Soaking the area in clean warm water, or applying warm compresses (clean guaze or wet paper towel) for 15 mins at a time, a few times daily can help to soothe and soften the skin and draw out wastes. Many piercees add 1/4 tsp sea salt for additional effect; epsom and table salts are NOT appropriate substitutes, and it's important that the solution should be no saltier than your own tears. Using too much salt, oversoaking, or substituting other kinda of salt may dry out the skin.</p>

		<h4>Herbal Compress</h4>
		<p>Mix equal parts of echinacea, goldseal, comfrey, and chamomile tea with 1 teaspoon of sea salt. Brew a strong and hot tea (infusion). Using a clean cloth, apply the strained infusion gently but firmly against the area. Between applications, turn the jewelry to coax out fluids. Do this for 10-15 mins twice daily.</p>

		<h4>Hydrogen Peroxide</h4>
		<p>Using a Q-tip, apply a small amount of liquid or gel hydrogen peroxide to the bump and turn the jewelry just slightly to get the peroxide to the base. This may help dissolve the dead cells and wash away fluids. Depending upon your skin sensitivity, this treatment may be used anywhere from twice weekly to twice daily, for 10-15 mins per application.</p>

		<h4>Tea Tree Oil/Grapefruit Seed Extract</h4>
		<p>Tea tree oil, like grapefruit seed extract, can be an effective, natural alternative, but can be very strong and very drying, even when diluted. Apply small amounts to the area, rotating the jewelry to bring some oil into the piercing. Do Not Rinse! Apply no more than twice daily; less if you are sensitive.</p>

		<h4>Hydrocortisone Cream</h4>
		<p>Non-prescription strength hydrocortisone cream can be very effective in reducing bumps. If you are immune suppressed or have a weakend immune system, be sure to consult a physician before using this steriod. (Very sensitive piercees should avoid this product altogether, as reactions can occur). Apply a small amount to the area, rotating the jewelry to bring some of the cream into the piercing. Do Not Rinse! Do not apply more than twice daily, a few times a week.</p>

		<h4>Aspirin</h4>
		<p>This method is most commonly and effectively used on oral keloids. If you are allergic to aspirin, do not try this method. Wet an aspirin or a small piece of aspirin, and place it directly on the bump for 5-30 mins, depending upon your skin's sensitivity. This will literally burn the bump off; as this method is so strong, don't use it more than once a day, 3 times a week. If your skin begins to chap or feel sore, discontinue and return to a gentler method.</p>
