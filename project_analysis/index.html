Website Redesign</br>
Project Analysis</br>
Truffles and Trifles</p> 


<h2>Site Intent</h2>

<p>The intent for the truffles and trifles website is to reorganize the content taking it from 13 pages to 6. Which will consist of Home, About Us, Classes, Gifts, News and Contact Us. The site will be more polished and user friendly by giving them what they want without users having to hunt for it. Markup will also be corrected instead of everything being nested inside table elements.</p>  

<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

<p></p>

<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>

<p>The target audience are females between the ages of 30 and 55 who are married with children who want to learn how to cook and bake. The route a person would take to sign up for a class would look something like this. They go to the truffles and trifles website look up information about the place read reviews from past customers and look at pictures. Then they would search upcoming classes and the prices. At the end they will register and pay for the class they want.</p>
